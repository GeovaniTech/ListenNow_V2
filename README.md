# ListenNow - Music Player

> Status: Finished✔️

### This is the second version of a music player I developed. In it you can add your music, as well as download and mainly play them.

### Developing this version I could apply the concepts of multithreading at the time of downloading, where in the first version when downloading the application froze, now this doesn't happen anymore.
### Main changes from the first version to this one:

- ### Layout Responsive
- ### Bank of data Mysql to qlite3

## Presentation
### https://bit.ly/Presentation-ListenNow

## Application Images
